Description: Implements a semiparametric spatiotemporal model for data with mixed frequencies,
    specifically where the response variable is observed at a lower frequency than some covariates.
    The estimation uses an iterative backfitting algorithm that combines a non-parametric smoothing spline
    for high-frequency data, parametric estimation for low-frequency and spatial neighborhood effects,
    and an autoregressive error structure. Methodology based on Malabanan, Lansangan, and Barrios (2022)
